## overview:

Smash Bot will be in a channel and track winners of previous tournaments.

A command will tell Smash Bot to start a tourney. It will post a link that will send an API GET request with the user's username. Once all users are in the tourney, a second Smash Bot command will close the tourney, post a tournament tree, and begin.
